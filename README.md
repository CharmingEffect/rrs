## Railway Reservation System 


The title of the project is called Railway Reservation System. To create the web application following technologies has been used:

*	Java Server Faces – for backend purposes.
*	TomEE – deploying server for the application. 
*	Primefaces – framework JSF for frontend purposes. 
*	MySQL – database. 
*	phpMyAdmin – manage the database.
*	Cascading Style Sheets – design.  
*	JavaScript – dynamic logic of the web app.
*	NetBeans – IDE for editing the code.
*	Ant – tool for automating software build processes.


The code for the application has been generated in NetBeans. The generation process is very useful feature in the IDE because it can save time for writing necessary methods for inserting, updating, and deleting data in database. The code has been modified to meet the requirements for the application such as user’s session. 


The purpose of the application is to find a train for specific connections and buy a ticket for it. The home screen has an ability to display a form for registering new user and option for logging existing user. Also, there is an option for choosing a theme. The guest can see all the available trains but cannot buy a ticket because the option is available only for registered users (I could not decide which theme to choose for the project, so I have included all of them!) When the user is logged in can see following options:
*	Home – the starting site of the application.
*	My Tickets – The site displays all the tickets which has been bought by the logged user for specific passenger. There is an option for cancelling the ticket. 
*	Search Train – The site displays all the available trains. Users can choose and buy a ticket for specific relation (the passenger needs to be chosen).
*	Add Passenger – the user can add a passenger to their list. There are also options for viewing the details edit and deleting the passenger.
*	Logout –user can invalidate the session which means can log out. 
The guest can only see the home page and search train.
